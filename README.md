I developed a C++ application that manages bus trips between major Romanian cities, featuring secure user authentication through a custom-made RSA encryption system for password storage. The program allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage travel plans by adding or removing trips, with built-in validation for dates and destinations. Data persistence is implemented using CSV files, and it also includes robust error handling for input validation and file operations.
